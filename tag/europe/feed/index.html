				<description><![CDATA[<p>So the flight is booked, and in a few weeks, months, or days you&#8217;ll be landing in Europe ready to begin your adventure! Here are our 10 tips for traveling Europe: &#160; 1. Travel in the off season  Dreaming of picnicking at the base of the Eiffel tower this summer? You are not alone there, summer is the busiest time to travel Europe. Avoid the summer months if you want to avoid long queues and large crowds. European tourist attractions can be a mess during peak season. Traveling off season will save you time and money! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Do as the locals do Try and blend in with the locals, don’t  stand out as an obnoxious tourist with bad manners. Be aware of your surroundings and try to follow what the locals do: grab a beer (doesn&#8217;t matter what time) or watch the local sport match. &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Travel by train Travelling by train may be more efficient and easier than air travel when exploring Europe. There are lots of options when it comes to booking your tickets: you can do it in person, at a kiosk, online, or use a rail planner app. You can also find deals and sales when it comes to using a Eurail pass. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Use budget airlines In Europe there&#8217;s no shortage of budget airlines with companies such as Ryanair or easyJet. Travelling around Europe by plane can be faster and sometimes even be cheaper. Airfares can often be cheaper than a train ticket if you book in advance, travel in the middle of the week, and pay attention to additional fees. Packing light or taking just a carry on will help you avoid additional fees! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Wear comfortable shoes One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must! &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Carry cash  While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash. &#160; &#160; 7. Stay longer in one place Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax! &#160; &#160; &#160; 8. Wonder off the beaten path I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9. Stay central  Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 10. Free city walking tours Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars! &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>
