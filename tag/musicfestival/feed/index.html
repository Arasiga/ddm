				<description><![CDATA[<p>Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF) is a night where thousands of edm (electric dance music) lovers from all walks of life, come together united by music. AMF falls at the heart of one of dance music’s most integral conference, the Amsterdam Dance Event during mid October. Together: We Own The Night. Getting tickets This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else! Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours! Finding accommodation When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night. Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at Hostelle (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue! Getting there As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage! But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing. Proper footwear Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared. Planning a fire outfit There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave. As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show. Hydration The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this! Don&#8217;t lose your friends Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated. Safe drug use AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue. This being said, illicit substances are still commonly seen within the crowd. So if you do choose to partake be sure you know what exactly you are taking and be aware of your surroundings. Respect the rules Every festival has its own set of rules so make sure you familiarize yourself with the list of do&#8217;s and don’ts before going. A helpful page is the FAQ section which can be found here: https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/</p>
