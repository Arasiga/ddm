				<description><![CDATA[<p>I had the amazing opportunity through my University&#8217;s co-op program to do an internship abroad for 4 months in Singapore. During my internship,  I didn&#8217;t get the leisure of traveling for more than a few days at a time. With some flexible work hours and a student budget, weekend getaways like this one to Hong Kong were still possible! This 3 day itinerary is great for anyone who may be doing a quick trip to Hong Kong or even if you are just looking for some inspiration for some activities to do that are on the cheaper side. &#160; &#160; I spent 3 days and 2 nights exploring the wonders this amazing city had to offer, and I think this was a good amount of time. Here&#8217;s how I did it! Day 1 Arrival A 3:30 am wake-up call is not as hard as it sounds when you are excited to be traveling. I had a 6:00 am flight which was great because I arrived early and could spend my day exploring the city. When I arrived it was around 11:00 am. I grabbed my Octopus card that I had pre-ordered online and headed out for my first adventure. Tip #1: Booking the Octopus card on Klook was only $14.65 CAD. It came pre-loaded with 50 HKD and no deposit fee. I also searched for promo codes online to get even more of a deal. &#160; Afternoon Ngong 360 cable cars is a great stop on your way to or from the airport because it&#8217;s only a 10 minute bus ride away! I decided take the cable cars right after landing in Hong Kong. To save some time, I kept my backpack with me for this part of the day and made sure to pack light so it wasn’t a bother. The gondola ride is a 25 minute trip up to Ngong Ping village where you can see Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Tip #2: Klook offers different packages for a discounted price, saving you about $5 CAD. More importantly, there is an express line for Klook pass holders that saved me an hour or two of waiting. &#160; &#160; After I finished walking around, I took a local bus (route 21) to Tai O a fishing village, a small area that is built on stilts. This was such a unique little community. I was on the fence about going but I&#8217;m so glad I went and saw it, I just wandered the streets and tried the different food stalls. Tip #3: Taking the bus only costs $1 CAD!! If you want to save some cash, I recommend taking the bus. &#160; Evening When I was done exploring, I headed back to Ngong Ping Village to catch the return gondola trip back down to the base. It was time to go check into the hostel and recharge. I stayed at YesInn Hostel near Causeway Bay which was a nice, social hostel. While sitting in the common area I met a few other travelers. We grabbed dinner and tried deep fried colon, it was surprisingly good! Tip #4: Look for small but busy restaurants to get delicious food for a cheap price. We found a small local restaurant that looked busy and got a sit down noodle dish for about $5 CAD.  To end the night, a few of us went to Lan Kwai Fong, the most popular nightlife area, and looked for happy hour deals. Tip #5: Stick to drinking only local beers to save money and avoid the expensive cocktail fees. &#160; Day 2 Morning To start my day off, I went on a Free Walking Tour I found online. This took up most of my morning and brought me all around the central area. I like walking tours because the guide gives you lots of insight into the history of the city and great travel tips from a local&#8217;s perspective. &#160; Afternoon In the afternoon I had time to grab lunch at a recommended Dim sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan. The line was massive so I opted for takeout instead. After eating lunch I went to Victoria Peak. I took the tram to the top and explored around the peak until I got to see the sun set over the hills. After the sunset, I went up to Peak Tower which was insanely busy at that time. I don’t recommend going at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. It was a nightmare, I couldn’t see a thing and it felt like such a waste of time. Tip #6: Use Klook to pre-book Victoria Peak tram and Sky Pass. I saved a few extra dollars and time because it gives you express entry &#8211; and trust me, on a weekend you&#8217;ll want that express entry if you don’t want to wait in the line for hours! &#160; Evening Symphony of Lights is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by Victoria Harbor, but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes. &#160; &#160; After the show, I went to Mr. Wong&#8217;s. This legendary place was recommended to me by a friend who did his exchange in Hong Kong. It is well known in the international students community and within travelers. Mr. Wong&#8217;s offers all you can eat Chinese buffet and all you can drink beers all night long! All of this for only $13 CAD. Day 3 Morning To make the most out of my last day, I woke up bright and early to make it to Dragons Back trail to do one last hike. Along the way, I stopped at the infamous building &#8220;montane mansions&#8221; to grab the Instagram worthy picture you always see. &#160; &#160; I walked the hike backwards starting from Chai Wan station and found the entrance using Google Maps. The hike took about 2 hours, but I took my time stopping to have my packed lunch at one of the lookout points (note: there are no refreshments along the way). Once I reached the end of the hike at the typical starting point in Shek O, I was able to easily catch a bus back to the MTR. &#160; Afternoon For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to Kowloon. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore. I started by getting off at Yau Ma Tei station and walked up through the Ladies Market. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine! From there I went up through the Goldfish Market which was so cool, there were pet stores lining each side of the street and fish just hanging in bags. I also made sure to stop at the Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens to take in the beautiful scenery. Tip #7: Remember to bargain and never take the original asking price because it is always hiked up! &#160; &#160; &#160; Before catching my flight I had one more stop, The Hong Kong Museum of History. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for FREE admission. After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling. &#160;</p>

<h3>Evening</h3>
<p><em>Symphony of Lights</em> is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by <em>Victoria Harbor,</em> but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-938 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="368" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg 4341w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-300x239.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-768x611.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1140x908.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to<em> Kowloon</em>. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore.</p>
<p>I started by getting off at <em>Yau Ma Tei station</em> and walked up through the <em>Ladies Market</em>. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine!

<p>Before catching my flight I had one more stop, <em>The</em> <em>Hong Kong Museum of History</em>. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for <strong>FREE</strong> admission.</p>
<p>After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>October is finally here which means it&#8217;s almost Halloween!! Whether you and your friends spend the holiday partying it up, going to haunted houses, or watching scary movies the biggest thing on everyone&#8217;s mind is what your Halloween costume will be. For many university/college students in Canada, this one day event is more often turned into a week-long affair. This means buying multiple expensive costumes is out of the question. Lucky for you we&#8217;ve got some tips and ideas to help you put together the perfect DIY costume that&#8217;s cheap, easy, and everyone&#8217;s going to love. Plan ahead I know this is something most of us students struggle with, but if you have a costume idea ahead of time you can take your time looking out for the perfect pieces to put it all together. No last minute runs to the dollar store only to find out they&#8217;ve run out of cat ears. A few years back my friends and I were very original and wanted to be Victoria Secret angels so we planned months in advance and got silk robes online from Amazon for only a few dollars, rather than spending $30+ in store. If you already own a silk robe and lingerie, all you need is some angel wings and you&#8217;ve got yourself a Halloween costume. &#160; &#160; Use what you have The best way to save money is not to spend anything at all! Have an old jersey in your closet or even your brothers closet, nothing says quick and easy costume better than an athlete. Take advantage of household items Get creative. Don’t have time to shop? No problem! with only a few sheets of newspaper and a jacket you&#8217;ve got a … news flash!! No newspaper? Don&#8217;t stress! Newspaper can be found for free at almost any street corner. No purchases necessary. &#160; &#160; Borrow from friends Don’t have anything lying around at home you can use (doubtful)? I bet your friends just might. Recycle old costumes and add your own personal touch. Back when &#8220;Despicable me&#8221; first came out I knew I just had to be minion (basic, I know). I saw my friend posted a picture in cute overalls and knew they would be perfect so I borrowed them for the night, added some personal touches and it ended up being a great costume. Be witty It&#8217;s so satisfying getting compliment on your costume that you only put some minor effort into. With a little creativity pulling together a great look for less has never been more rewarding. Here we all are as beanie babies &#8211; a cute twist to the basic animal ear costume every girl has done at least once. &#160; &#160; Do you Try and think outside the box, what makes you, you? thinking of a costume is much easier when you think about what you love and make it come to life. For Alicia and I, wine is our one true love so what better costumes than being a couple of wine boxes. All we did was find a burgundy body suit (easy and spent less than $10, which we still wear regularly), some plastic cellophane, and printed out our favorite wine label. &#160; &#160; Group costumes Group costumes are always fun to plan with your friends and makes it easier with more people brainstorming ideas. You&#8217;re bound to come up with something good! Here we are in first year as the Mario party squad each getting our costumes for under $10. &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>London is known for its culture, style and history making this city one of the most visited in the world. Typically being pegged as one of the worlds most expensive cities, young backpackers may be intimidated by this beautiful city. Although pricey, it is also one of the best cities to explore and find fun, FREE activities to do. Here&#8217;s a list of a few of my favourite free things to do when exploring London: &#160; &#160; Sky garden  The famous enlarged glass dome showcases three stories of exquisitely landscaped public gardens and London’s most exclusive social spaces, including observation decks and an open air terrace. This space is free to the public as long as you reserve a time slot by booking a ticket online before you go. You can grab a bite to eat at the café or check out the Sky Bar while exploring the beautiful garden, we found this to be a great place to start our day off! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Platform 9 3/4  If you are a Harry Potter fan then you know that at King&#8217;s Cross Station, central London, platform 9 3/4  is kind of a big deal. The Harry Potter Shop at Platform 9 3/4 is filled with every magical artifact you can imagine and its free to look around and get your photo taken running to the Hogwarts Express! Huge Harry Potter fan and don&#8217;t mind spending a little? Check out our post on the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London &#8211; The Making of Harry Potter. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Markets  There is no better way to explore the city than wondering through and between London&#8217;s markets. Anything you are looking for can be found in one of the many markets scattered throughout the city. A few of my favourites were Camden,  Borough, and Portobello Markets. &#160; &#160; &#160; Tower Bridge Tower bridge is one of London&#8217;s must see landmarks and lucky for us its free to see! Spanning across the Thames river this magnificent architecture captures the hearts of many tourists, I know it took us over an hour to cross it because we were so amazed! (Actually because we were being basic and taking a lot of pictures) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Hyde Park Hyde Park is one of London’s eight Royal Parks and covers an area of 350 acres. Many events and activities are hosted here all throughout the year. Of course in the winter when I was here for the first time it was the famous &#8220;Christmas Extravaganza&#8221; Winter Wonderland! Definitely a must-see for winter travelers in London! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Big Ben  One of London&#8217;s most iconic tourist attraction is Big Ben, who stands beside the Houses of Parliament. This enormous clock tower which rarely falls silent (even standing strong during WWII), is currently silent until August 2021 while conservation work is done. &#160; &#160; &#160; The London EYE  Across the River Thames on the South Bank of the is another of London&#8217;s famous spots, Coca-Cola London EYE. This massive Ferris wheel is the tallest in Europe and is one of the cities best look out points. Unfortunately if you want to ride this attraction it will cost you, but if you are on a budget I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s still worth having a look at! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Changing of the Guards  This world-famous Changing of the Guards which takes place at Buckingham Palace is a must see for anyone in London. It doesn’t matter what time of the year you go, this event is guaranteed to bring a huge crowd so be prepared to peer between heads and stand on your tippy toes. This happens every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 11:00 am sharp! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Museums Being one of the worlds capitals of culture its no surprise that many museums here are free to explore! Tate Modern, National Gallery, Museum of London, and British Museum were just a few of my favourites I got the pleasure of touring while there. &#160; &#160;</p>

<h2><b>Markets </b></h2>
<p>There is no better way to explore the city than wondering through and between London&#8217;s markets. Anything you are looking for can be found in one of the many markets scattered throughout the city. A few of my favourites were</p>
<p>Camden,  Borough, and Portobello Markets.</p>

<h2><b>Tower Bridge</b></h2>
<p>Tower bridge is one of London&#8217;s must see landmarks and lucky for us its free to see! Spanning across the Thames river this magnificent architecture captures the hearts of many tourists, I know it took us over an hour to cross it because we were so amazed! (Actually because we were being basic and taking a lot of pictures)</p>

<h2><b>Hyde Park</b></h2>
<p>Hyde Park is one of London’s <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks">eight Royal Parks</a> and covers an area of 350 acres. Many events and activities are hosted here all throughout the year. Of course in the winter when I was here for the first time it was the famous &#8220;Christmas Extravaganza&#8221; <a href="http://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/">Winter Wonderland</a>! Definitely a must-see for winter travelers in London!</p>

<h2><b>Big Ben </b></h2>
<p>One of London&#8217;s most iconic tourist attraction is Big Ben, who stands beside the Houses of Parliament. This enormous clock tower which rarely falls silent (even standing strong during WWII), is currently silent until August 2021 while conservation work is done.</p>

<h2><b>The London EYE </b></h2>
<p>Across the River Thames on the South Bank of the is another of London&#8217;s famous spots, Coca-Cola London EYE. This massive Ferris wheel is the tallest in Europe and is one of the cities best look out points. Unfortunately if you want to ride this attraction it will cost you, but if you are on a budget I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s still worth having a look at!</p>
