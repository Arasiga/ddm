				<description><![CDATA[<p>I had the amazing opportunity through my University&#8217;s co-op program to do an internship abroad for 4 months in Singapore. During my internship,  I didn&#8217;t get the leisure of traveling for more than a few days at a time. With some flexible work hours and a student budget, weekend getaways like this one to Hong Kong were still possible! This 3 day itinerary is great for anyone who may be doing a quick trip to Hong Kong or even if you are just looking for some inspiration for some activities to do that are on the cheaper side. &#160; &#160; I spent 3 days and 2 nights exploring the wonders this amazing city had to offer, and I think this was a good amount of time. Here&#8217;s how I did it! Day 1 Arrival A 3:30 am wake-up call is not as hard as it sounds when you are excited to be traveling. I had a 6:00 am flight which was great because I arrived early and could spend my day exploring the city. When I arrived it was around 11:00 am. I grabbed my Octopus card that I had pre-ordered online and headed out for my first adventure. Tip #1: Booking the Octopus card on Klook was only $14.65 CAD. It came pre-loaded with 50 HKD and no deposit fee. I also searched for promo codes online to get even more of a deal. &#160; Afternoon Ngong 360 cable cars is a great stop on your way to or from the airport because it&#8217;s only a 10 minute bus ride away! I decided take the cable cars right after landing in Hong Kong. To save some time, I kept my backpack with me for this part of the day and made sure to pack light so it wasn’t a bother. The gondola ride is a 25 minute trip up to Ngong Ping village where you can see Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Tip #2: Klook offers different packages for a discounted price, saving you about $5 CAD. More importantly, there is an express line for Klook pass holders that saved me an hour or two of waiting. &#160; &#160; After I finished walking around, I took a local bus (route 21) to Tai O a fishing village, a small area that is built on stilts. This was such a unique little community. I was on the fence about going but I&#8217;m so glad I went and saw it, I just wandered the streets and tried the different food stalls. Tip #3: Taking the bus only costs $1 CAD!! If you want to save some cash, I recommend taking the bus. &#160; Evening When I was done exploring, I headed back to Ngong Ping Village to catch the return gondola trip back down to the base. It was time to go check into the hostel and recharge. I stayed at YesInn Hostel near Causeway Bay which was a nice, social hostel. While sitting in the common area I met a few other travelers. We grabbed dinner and tried deep fried colon, it was surprisingly good! Tip #4: Look for small but busy restaurants to get delicious food for a cheap price. We found a small local restaurant that looked busy and got a sit down noodle dish for about $5 CAD.  To end the night, a few of us went to Lan Kwai Fong, the most popular nightlife area, and looked for happy hour deals. Tip #5: Stick to drinking only local beers to save money and avoid the expensive cocktail fees. &#160; Day 2 Morning To start my day off, I went on a Free Walking Tour I found online. This took up most of my morning and brought me all around the central area. I like walking tours because the guide gives you lots of insight into the history of the city and great travel tips from a local&#8217;s perspective. &#160; Afternoon In the afternoon I had time to grab lunch at a recommended Dim sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan. The line was massive so I opted for takeout instead. After eating lunch I went to Victoria Peak. I took the tram to the top and explored around the peak until I got to see the sun set over the hills. After the sunset, I went up to Peak Tower which was insanely busy at that time. I don’t recommend going at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. It was a nightmare, I couldn’t see a thing and it felt like such a waste of time. Tip #6: Use Klook to pre-book Victoria Peak tram and Sky Pass. I saved a few extra dollars and time because it gives you express entry &#8211; and trust me, on a weekend you&#8217;ll want that express entry if you don’t want to wait in the line for hours! &#160; Evening Symphony of Lights is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by Victoria Harbor, but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes. &#160; &#160; After the show, I went to Mr. Wong&#8217;s. This legendary place was recommended to me by a friend who did his exchange in Hong Kong. It is well known in the international students community and within travelers. Mr. Wong&#8217;s offers all you can eat Chinese buffet and all you can drink beers all night long! All of this for only $13 CAD. Day 3 Morning To make the most out of my last day, I woke up bright and early to make it to Dragons Back trail to do one last hike. Along the way, I stopped at the infamous building &#8220;montane mansions&#8221; to grab the Instagram worthy picture you always see. &#160; &#160; I walked the hike backwards starting from Chai Wan station and found the entrance using Google Maps. The hike took about 2 hours, but I took my time stopping to have my packed lunch at one of the lookout points (note: there are no refreshments along the way). Once I reached the end of the hike at the typical starting point in Shek O, I was able to easily catch a bus back to the MTR. &#160; Afternoon For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to Kowloon. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore. I started by getting off at Yau Ma Tei station and walked up through the Ladies Market. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine! From there I went up through the Goldfish Market which was so cool, there were pet stores lining each side of the street and fish just hanging in bags. I also made sure to stop at the Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens to take in the beautiful scenery. Tip #7: Remember to bargain and never take the original asking price because it is always hiked up! &#160; &#160; &#160; Before catching my flight I had one more stop, The Hong Kong Museum of History. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for FREE admission. After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling. &#160;</p>

<h3>Evening</h3>
<p><em>Symphony of Lights</em> is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by <em>Victoria Harbor,</em> but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-938 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="368" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg 4341w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-300x239.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-768x611.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1140x908.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to<em> Kowloon</em>. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore.</p>
<p>I started by getting off at <em>Yau Ma Tei station</em> and walked up through the <em>Ladies Market</em>. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine!

<p>Before catching my flight I had one more stop, <em>The</em> <em>Hong Kong Museum of History</em>. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for <strong>FREE</strong> admission.</p>
<p>After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling.</p>
