				<description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong was my first official solo trip and I loved every moment of it. As a first-time solo female traveler, I was looking for a safe Southeast Asian country to visit. Hong Kong was a perfect destination for my first solo trip! The crime rates here are one of the lowest in the world and the city is prefect blend of East-meets-West. Here are my tips for the solo traveler looking to visit Hong Kong on their own! &#160; Where To Stay When deciding where to stay I usually do two things: First, I go to Hostelworld and look up the city I&#8217;m travelling to. Second, I filter the reviews to 8.0 or higher then sort by price. From there I go down the list reading reviews and comparing the location. I try and get one close to city center where most of the attractions are. For Hong Kong, I stayed a bit outside of the city center but with the great metro system I was only a short ride away. Yesinn at Causeaway Bay was a great find with wonderful staff, amenities and friendly travelers! Getting Around As mentioned above, the transit system here is great! I picked up a tourist Octopus card that allowed me to load money and travel on buses, trams, and the subway. I booked mine ahead of time and got it at the airport using Klook. It came preloaded with $50 HKD with no deposit fee &#8211; meaning you can take the card home! And don’t worry, if you have left over money it can be refunded. (Although I didn’t because it seemed like too much of a hassle for $5.) &#160; Where to Eat If you are trying to save on cash, eat at local stalls or shops because they are very affordable, delicious and friendly. If you decide to check out the fishing village, Tai O, be sure to try fish sui mai and fresh cuddle fish. When walking around the markets, find a stand that looks busy and pick anything that looks good. Go for something new and get outside of your comfort zone! Explore Hong Kong One of my favorite things to do in a new city is just walk around the neighborhoods with no goal in mind. If you are near the city center, you will often find many markets or local food stalls. If you don’t like the idea of that, sign up for a free walking tour! The tour guide will take you around the main areas and teach you a lot about the history and culture. &#160; Go on an Adventure For me, I love the craziness of a big city mixed with the serenity of nature. Contrary to the popular belief that Hong Kong is a concrete jungle, there are actually plenty of greenery and great hikes all over to get away from the rush of the city. I preferred Dragons Back over Victoria Peak as it was less touristy and crowded so I really got to escape the city and enjoy my walk. &#160; Nightlife I love going out in new places and seeing how the party scene changes from one place to another. In Hong Kong, there are two main nightlife areas: Lan Kwai Fong in Central, and Lockhart Road in Wan Chai &#8211; both will give you a wild night! Bar hopping is the best way to see the area. If you get there before 9/10:00 pm you can make it to happy hour and save a few bucks. I have to say, my favourite place to drink wasn’t a local bar but actually Mr. Wong&#8217;s, an all you can eat and DRINK (beer) restaurant. This is a popular spot for travelers and exchange students so when I showed up alone, a table of fellow travelers welcomed me with open arms. We ate and played drinking games into the night! Hong Kong Itinerary Hong Kong is definitely a city I&#8217;m looking forward to returning to one day. There is so much to see and do, I barely scratched the surface on my own. I highly recommend any solo travelers packing their bags and making the trip.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I had the amazing opportunity through my University&#8217;s co-op program to do an internship abroad for 4 months in Singapore. During my internship,  I didn&#8217;t get the leisure of traveling for more than a few days at a time. With some flexible work hours and a student budget, weekend getaways like this one to Hong Kong were still possible! This 3 day itinerary is great for anyone who may be doing a quick trip to Hong Kong or even if you are just looking for some inspiration for some activities to do that are on the cheaper side. &#160; &#160; I spent 3 days and 2 nights exploring the wonders this amazing city had to offer, and I think this was a good amount of time. Here&#8217;s how I did it! Day 1 Arrival A 3:30 am wake-up call is not as hard as it sounds when you are excited to be traveling. I had a 6:00 am flight which was great because I arrived early and could spend my day exploring the city. When I arrived it was around 11:00 am. I grabbed my Octopus card that I had pre-ordered online and headed out for my first adventure. Tip #1: Booking the Octopus card on Klook was only $14.65 CAD. It came pre-loaded with 50 HKD and no deposit fee. I also searched for promo codes online to get even more of a deal. &#160; Afternoon Ngong 360 cable cars is a great stop on your way to or from the airport because it&#8217;s only a 10 minute bus ride away! I decided take the cable cars right after landing in Hong Kong. To save some time, I kept my backpack with me for this part of the day and made sure to pack light so it wasn’t a bother. The gondola ride is a 25 minute trip up to Ngong Ping village where you can see Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Tip #2: Klook offers different packages for a discounted price, saving you about $5 CAD. More importantly, there is an express line for Klook pass holders that saved me an hour or two of waiting. &#160; &#160; After I finished walking around, I took a local bus (route 21) to Tai O a fishing village, a small area that is built on stilts. This was such a unique little community. I was on the fence about going but I&#8217;m so glad I went and saw it, I just wandered the streets and tried the different food stalls. Tip #3: Taking the bus only costs $1 CAD!! If you want to save some cash, I recommend taking the bus. &#160; Evening When I was done exploring, I headed back to Ngong Ping Village to catch the return gondola trip back down to the base. It was time to go check into the hostel and recharge. I stayed at YesInn Hostel near Causeway Bay which was a nice, social hostel. While sitting in the common area I met a few other travelers. We grabbed dinner and tried deep fried colon, it was surprisingly good! Tip #4: Look for small but busy restaurants to get delicious food for a cheap price. We found a small local restaurant that looked busy and got a sit down noodle dish for about $5 CAD.  To end the night, a few of us went to Lan Kwai Fong, the most popular nightlife area, and looked for happy hour deals. Tip #5: Stick to drinking only local beers to save money and avoid the expensive cocktail fees. &#160; Day 2 Morning To start my day off, I went on a Free Walking Tour I found online. This took up most of my morning and brought me all around the central area. I like walking tours because the guide gives you lots of insight into the history of the city and great travel tips from a local&#8217;s perspective. &#160; Afternoon In the afternoon I had time to grab lunch at a recommended Dim sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan. The line was massive so I opted for takeout instead. After eating lunch I went to Victoria Peak. I took the tram to the top and explored around the peak until I got to see the sun set over the hills. After the sunset, I went up to Peak Tower which was insanely busy at that time. I don’t recommend going at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. It was a nightmare, I couldn’t see a thing and it felt like such a waste of time. Tip #6: Use Klook to pre-book Victoria Peak tram and Sky Pass. I saved a few extra dollars and time because it gives you express entry &#8211; and trust me, on a weekend you&#8217;ll want that express entry if you don’t want to wait in the line for hours! &#160; Evening Symphony of Lights is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by Victoria Harbor, but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes. &#160; &#160; After the show, I went to Mr. Wong&#8217;s. This legendary place was recommended to me by a friend who did his exchange in Hong Kong. It is well known in the international students community and within travelers. Mr. Wong&#8217;s offers all you can eat Chinese buffet and all you can drink beers all night long! All of this for only $13 CAD. Day 3 Morning To make the most out of my last day, I woke up bright and early to make it to Dragons Back trail to do one last hike. Along the way, I stopped at the infamous building &#8220;montane mansions&#8221; to grab the Instagram worthy picture you always see. &#160; &#160; I walked the hike backwards starting from Chai Wan station and found the entrance using Google Maps. The hike took about 2 hours, but I took my time stopping to have my packed lunch at one of the lookout points (note: there are no refreshments along the way). Once I reached the end of the hike at the typical starting point in Shek O, I was able to easily catch a bus back to the MTR. &#160; Afternoon For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to Kowloon. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore. I started by getting off at Yau Ma Tei station and walked up through the Ladies Market. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine! From there I went up through the Goldfish Market which was so cool, there were pet stores lining each side of the street and fish just hanging in bags. I also made sure to stop at the Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens to take in the beautiful scenery. Tip #7: Remember to bargain and never take the original asking price because it is always hiked up! &#160; &#160; &#160; Before catching my flight I had one more stop, The Hong Kong Museum of History. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for FREE admission. After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling. &#160;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I finished walking around, I took a local bus (route 21) to <em>Tai O a fishing village</em>, a small area that is built on stilts. This was such a unique little community. I was on the fence about going but I&#8217;m so glad I went and saw it, I just wandered the streets and tried the different food stalls.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip #3:</strong> Taking the bus only costs $1 CAD!! If you want to save some cash, I recommend taking the bus.</em></p>

<h3>Evening</h3>
<p>When I was done exploring, I headed back to <em>Ngong Ping Village</em> to catch the return gondola trip back down to the base. It was time to go check into the hostel and recharge. I stayed at <em>YesInn Hostel</em> near <em>Causeway Bay</em> which was a nice, social hostel. While sitting in the common area I met a few other travelers. We grabbed dinner and tried deep fried colon, it was surprisingly good!</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip #4: </strong></em><em>Look for small but busy restaurants to get delicious food for a cheap price. </em><em>We found a small local restaurant that looked busy and got a sit down noodle dish for about $5 CAD. </em></p>
<p>To end the night, a few of us went to <em>Lan Kwai Fong</em>, the most popular nightlife area, and looked for happy hour deals.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip #5: </strong>Stick to drinking only local beers to save money and avoid the expensive cocktail fees.</em></p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>To start my day off, I went on a Free Walking Tour I found online. This took up most of my morning and brought me all around the central area. I like walking tours because the guide gives you lots of insight into the history of the city and great travel tips from a local&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-944 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="347" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500.jpg 4608w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3500-1140x855.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the afternoon I had time to grab lunch at a recommended Dim sum restaurant, <em>Tim Ho Wan</em>. The line was massive so I opted for takeout instead.</p>
<p>After eating lunch I went to <em>Victoria Peak</em>. I took the tram to the top and explored around the peak until I got to see the sun set over the hills. After the sunset, I went up to <em>Peak Tower</em> which was insanely busy at that time. I don’t recommend going at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. It was a nightmare, I couldn’t see a thing and it felt like such a waste of time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip #6:</strong> Use Klook to pre-book Victoria Peak tram and Sky Pass. I saved a few extra dollars and time because it gives you express entry &#8211; and trust me, on a weekend you&#8217;ll want that express entry if you don’t want to wait in the line for hours!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-937 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="347" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon.jpg 4608w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2afternoon-1140x855.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<h3>Evening</h3>
<p><em>Symphony of Lights</em> is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by <em>Victoria Harbor,</em> but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-938 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="368" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg 4341w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-300x239.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-768x611.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1140x908.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the show, I went to <em>Mr. Wong&#8217;s</em>. This legendary place was recommended to me by a friend who did his exchange in Hong Kong. It is well known in the international students community and within travelers. Mr. Wong&#8217;s offers all you can eat Chinese buffet and all you can drink beers all night long! All of this for only $13 CAD.</p>
<h1>Day 3</h1>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>To make the most out of my last day, I woke up bright and early to make it to <em>Dragons Back trail</em> to do one last hike. Along the way, I stopped at the infamous building <em>&#8220;montane mansions&#8221;</em> to grab the Instagram worthy picture you always see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-940 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="346" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2.jpg 4545w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day3morning2-1140x855.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked the hike backwards starting from <em>Chai Wan station</em> and found the entrance using Google Maps. The hike took about 2 hours, but I took my time stopping to have my packed lunch at one of the lookout points (note: there are <strong>no</strong> refreshments along the way). Once I reached the end of the hike at the typical starting point in <em>Shek O,</em> I was able to easily catch a bus back to the MTR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-941" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70029103.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="538" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70029103.jpg 3024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70029103-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70029103-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70029103-1140x1520.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to<em> Kowloon</em>. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore.</p>
<p>I started by getting off at <em>Yau Ma Tei station</em> and walked up through the <em>Ladies Market</em>. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine! From there I went up through the <em>Goldfish Market</em> which was so cool, there were pet stores lining each side of the street and fish just hanging in bags. I also made sure to stop at the <em>Chi Lin Nunnery</em> and Nan <em>Lian Gardens</em> to take in the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip #7:</strong> Remember to bargain and never take the original asking price because it is always hiked up!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-942 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="347" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105.jpg 4032w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_70229105-1140x855.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before catching my flight I had one more stop, <em>The</em> <em>Hong Kong Museum of History</em>. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for <strong>FREE</strong> admission.</p>
<p>After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>So the flight is booked, and in a few weeks, months, or days you&#8217;ll be landing in Europe ready to begin your adventure! Here are our 10 tips for traveling Europe: &#160; 1. Travel in the off season  Dreaming of picnicking at the base of the Eiffel tower this summer? You are not alone there, summer is the busiest time to travel Europe. Avoid the summer months if you want to avoid long queues and large crowds. European tourist attractions can be a mess during peak season. Traveling off season will save you time and money! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Do as the locals do Try and blend in with the locals, don’t  stand out as an obnoxious tourist with bad manners. Be aware of your surroundings and try to follow what the locals do: grab a beer (doesn&#8217;t matter what time) or watch the local sport match. &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Travel by train Travelling by train may be more efficient and easier than air travel when exploring Europe. There are lots of options when it comes to booking your tickets: you can do it in person, at a kiosk, online, or use a rail planner app. You can also find deals and sales when it comes to using a Eurail pass. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Use budget airlines In Europe there&#8217;s no shortage of budget airlines with companies such as Ryanair or easyJet. Travelling around Europe by plane can be faster and sometimes even be cheaper. Airfares can often be cheaper than a train ticket if you book in advance, travel in the middle of the week, and pay attention to additional fees. Packing light or taking just a carry on will help you avoid additional fees! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Wear comfortable shoes One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must! &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Carry cash  While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash. &#160; &#160; 7. Stay longer in one place Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax! &#160; &#160; &#160; 8. Wonder off the beaten path I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9. Stay central  Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 10. Free city walking tours Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars! &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>

<h2><b>4. Use budget airlines</b></h2>
<p>In Europe there&#8217;s no shortage of budget airlines with companies such as Ryanair or easyJet. Travelling around Europe by plane can be faster and sometimes even be cheaper. Airfares can often be cheaper than a train ticket if you book in advance, travel in the middle of the week, and pay attention to additional fees. Packing light or taking just a carry on will help you avoid additional fees!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>5. Wear comfortable shoes</b></h2>
<p>One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-823 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="306" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2.jpg 5184w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>6. Carry cash </b></h2>
<p>While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-410 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa3-2-e1534307333622.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="328" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>7. Stay longer in one place</b></h2>
<p>Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-819 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="344" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2.jpg 4456w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-300x224.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-768x574.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-1140x853.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>8. Wonder off the beaten path</b></h2>
<p>I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-825 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="306" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1.jpg 5182w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>9. Stay central </b></h2>
<p>Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-822 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="307" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2.jpg 5184w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>10. Free city walking tours</b></h2>
<p>Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; Are you still patiently waiting for your letter from Hogwarts? Prepared to drop out of college to attend a school for witchcraft and wizardry? Me too! &#160; &#160; Being only an hour bus ride away from the Warner Bros. Studio Tour we just had to visit “The Making of Harry Potter”. This tour features costumes,  props, how special effects are used, facts about the actors and film crew, and complete movie sets from the filming of all 8 movies. Stepping into the studio tour was like stepping into the movies.  The tour starts off with a short film about the experience and the franchise and then the doors to the Great Hall are opened.  This massive set is decorated depending on the current season. For us, we went in October and were treated to a Halloween feast with the gold plates full and Jack-o-lanterns hanging from the enchanted ceiling. When you walk through the tour, there is everything from the &#8220;Sorting Hat&#8221; to the &#8220;Forbidden Forest&#8221;. The studio tour is all set up  for us muggles to explore! Here are some helpful tips to help you plan your magical getaway. &#160; &#160; Booking tickets in advance  Booking your tickets online in advance is required because they do not sell tickets at the door due to a limited number of visitors that can visit the Studio Tour at any one time. They do this to  ensure you have the best experience possible! Now if you are on exchange like us, chances are your school/ other students will run a trip here at least once a term so keep your eyes open! We went to the tour with a student-led group that had our travel and tickets covered for only £20.00, saving us nearly $50 CAN. Standard Ticket Prices: Adult (Ages 16 years and above) £41.00 Child (Ages 5 to 15 years) £33.00 Group rates and family passes are also available. &#160; &#160; Getting there The Studio is located almost 45 minutes outside of central London, but don’t worry, getting there isn&#8217;t hard. If you plan on driving, there is free parking available by showing your booking confirmation. Driving as a foreigner is not always easy so I suggest taking the train to Watford Junction station where shuttle buses run round trip for only £2.50 (cash only). &#160; When you arrive It is recommended you arrive 20 minutes prior to your ticketed time. Before your tour begins, you will have access to the Lobby Café, Studio Shop, cloakroom, and toilet facilities. Keep in mind, there is no food during the tour but a break about half way through in the back-lot allows you to picnic if you brought food. You can also buy food there or try some Harry Potter themed treats like Butterbeer! &#160; Souvenirs  As you can imagine the gift shop has everything imaginable related to Harry Potter and the Wizarding world. You may break the bank if you go in blind, so have a budget and some specific ideas of things you want to bring home. And if you are on a student budget (no budget), the good news is you can take  photos throughout the tour to save all your memories! Are you a Harry Potter fan? If you aren&#8217;t, we kindly ask you to please re-evaluate your life.  &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, this one is for you:  now we are all about equality and feminism but sometimes you just have to work with what you were given, and that’s not a bad thing! We are going to give you some of our best tips for going out on the town without spending any money. Do your research Exploring a city for the first time and not sure where to go?  There are tones of online resources available to help you find exactly the kind of night you are looking for. For example, DesignMyNight is a good one we used every time we went out in the UK. We found this great place in London, Ballie Ballerson, that has a fun ball pit to play at the bar! Use social media Once you got a few names from this search head over to the bar/club&#8217;s Facebook or other social media to see if they have any events running and past reviews on their site. Keep in mind, when reading reviews a lot will be negative as more people tend to write a review after having a bad experience rather than after having a great night. Guest list From the bars website or over Facebook, look for a bar with guest list which usually gets you in for free and sometimes even skip the line. All it takes is submitting your name through a quick message to their Facebook or submitting a form online. When you do this, typically you have to go early and the bar may be dead when you arrive but trust me, it will pick up! It&#8217;s totally worth it if you don&#8217;t want to pay for cover. Keep your eyes open Most people will tell you to walk with your head up, but I&#8217;m going to tell you the opposite. Because if you keep your head down and your eyes open then there&#8217;s a better chance you will be the lucky one to find that $10 bill (or whatever currency the country you&#8217;re in uses) on the ground.  Trust me, there&#8217;s no better feeling then finding that bill and running straight to the bar for drinks! Free drinks Drinks are always good, but free drinks are even better. Just be aware when getting drinks from strangers at the bar. Never accept a drink you didn&#8217;t see the bar tender make as unfortunate as it is, it is so easy for someone to slip something in it Find the bottles Bottle service is your friend. So many good nights we&#8217;ve had by meeting groups with bottle service there to celebrate. Especially as a traveler, meeting new people is what it&#8217;s all about …. And maybe you&#8217;ll get a free drink after the introduction. Bring the bottles That sparkly flask your friends got you for your 19th birthday, well now is the time to use it. Now almost all bars don’t allow outside drinks so you know… don&#8217;t get caught. And when you need chase to wash down your shots ask for a lemon slice over paying for chase, they&#8217;re free.</p>
