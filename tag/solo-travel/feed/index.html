				<description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong was my first official solo trip and I loved every moment of it. As a first-time solo female traveler, I was looking for a safe Southeast Asian country to visit. Hong Kong was a perfect destination for my first solo trip! The crime rates here are one of the lowest in the world and the city is prefect blend of East-meets-West. Here are my tips for the solo traveler looking to visit Hong Kong on their own! &#160; Where To Stay When deciding where to stay I usually do two things: First, I go to Hostelworld and look up the city I&#8217;m travelling to. Second, I filter the reviews to 8.0 or higher then sort by price. From there I go down the list reading reviews and comparing the location. I try and get one close to city center where most of the attractions are. For Hong Kong, I stayed a bit outside of the city center but with the great metro system I was only a short ride away. Yesinn at Causeaway Bay was a great find with wonderful staff, amenities and friendly travelers! Getting Around As mentioned above, the transit system here is great! I picked up a tourist Octopus card that allowed me to load money and travel on buses, trams, and the subway. I booked mine ahead of time and got it at the airport using Klook. It came preloaded with $50 HKD with no deposit fee &#8211; meaning you can take the card home! And don’t worry, if you have left over money it can be refunded. (Although I didn’t because it seemed like too much of a hassle for $5.) &#160; Where to Eat If you are trying to save on cash, eat at local stalls or shops because they are very affordable, delicious and friendly. If you decide to check out the fishing village, Tai O, be sure to try fish sui mai and fresh cuddle fish. When walking around the markets, find a stand that looks busy and pick anything that looks good. Go for something new and get outside of your comfort zone! Explore Hong Kong One of my favorite things to do in a new city is just walk around the neighborhoods with no goal in mind. If you are near the city center, you will often find many markets or local food stalls. If you don’t like the idea of that, sign up for a free walking tour! The tour guide will take you around the main areas and teach you a lot about the history and culture. &#160; Go on an Adventure For me, I love the craziness of a big city mixed with the serenity of nature. Contrary to the popular belief that Hong Kong is a concrete jungle, there are actually plenty of greenery and great hikes all over to get away from the rush of the city. I preferred Dragons Back over Victoria Peak as it was less touristy and crowded so I really got to escape the city and enjoy my walk. &#160; Nightlife I love going out in new places and seeing how the party scene changes from one place to another. In Hong Kong, there are two main nightlife areas: Lan Kwai Fong in Central, and Lockhart Road in Wan Chai &#8211; both will give you a wild night! Bar hopping is the best way to see the area. If you get there before 9/10:00 pm you can make it to happy hour and save a few bucks. I have to say, my favourite place to drink wasn’t a local bar but actually Mr. Wong&#8217;s, an all you can eat and DRINK (beer) restaurant. This is a popular spot for travelers and exchange students so when I showed up alone, a table of fellow travelers welcomed me with open arms. We ate and played drinking games into the night! Hong Kong Itinerary Hong Kong is definitely a city I&#8217;m looking forward to returning to one day. There is so much to see and do, I barely scratched the surface on my own. I highly recommend any solo travelers packing their bags and making the trip. For a more detailed itinerary and how I managed a budget getaway to Hong Kong, check out my 3 day budget itinerary! &#160;</p>
