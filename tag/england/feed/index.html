				<description><![CDATA[<p>London is known for its culture, style and history making this city one of the most visited in the world. Typically being pegged as one of the worlds most expensive cities, young backpackers may be intimidated by this beautiful city. Although pricey, it is also one of the best cities to explore and find fun, FREE activities to do. Here&#8217;s a list of a few of my favourite free things to do when exploring London: &#160; &#160; Sky garden  The famous enlarged glass dome showcases three stories of exquisitely landscaped public gardens and London’s most exclusive social spaces, including observation decks and an open air terrace. This space is free to the public as long as you reserve a time slot by booking a ticket online before you go. You can grab a bite to eat at the café or check out the Sky Bar while exploring the beautiful garden, we found this to be a great place to start our day off! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Platform 9 3/4  If you are a Harry Potter fan then you know that at King&#8217;s Cross Station, central London, platform 9 3/4  is kind of a big deal. The Harry Potter Shop at Platform 9 3/4 is filled with every magical artifact you can imagine and its free to look around and get your photo taken running to the Hogwarts Express! Huge Harry Potter fan and don&#8217;t mind spending a little? Check out our post on the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London &#8211; The Making of Harry Potter. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Markets  There is no better way to explore the city than wondering through and between London&#8217;s markets. Anything you are looking for can be found in one of the many markets scattered throughout the city. A few of my favourites were Camden,  Borough, and Portobello Markets. &#160; &#160; &#160; Tower Bridge Tower bridge is one of London&#8217;s must see landmarks and lucky for us its free to see! Spanning across the Thames river this magnificent architecture captures the hearts of many tourists, I know it took us over an hour to cross it because we were so amazed! (Actually because we were being basic and taking a lot of pictures) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Hyde Park Hyde Park is one of London’s eight Royal Parks and covers an area of 350 acres. Many events and activities are hosted here all throughout the year. Of course in the winter when I was here for the first time it was the famous &#8220;Christmas Extravaganza&#8221; Winter Wonderland! Definitely a must-see for winter travelers in London! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Big Ben  One of London&#8217;s most iconic tourist attraction is Big Ben, who stands beside the Houses of Parliament. This enormous clock tower which rarely falls silent (even standing strong during WWII), is currently silent until August 2021 while conservation work is done. &#160; &#160; &#160; The London EYE  Across the River Thames on the South Bank of the is another of London&#8217;s famous spots, Coca-Cola London EYE. This massive Ferris wheel is the tallest in Europe and is one of the cities best look out points. Unfortunately if you want to ride this attraction it will cost you, but if you are on a budget I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s still worth having a look at! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Changing of the Guards  This world-famous Changing of the Guards which takes place at Buckingham Palace is a must see for anyone in London. It doesn’t matter what time of the year you go, this event is guaranteed to bring a huge crowd so be prepared to peer between heads and stand on your tippy toes. This happens every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 11:00 am sharp! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Museums Being one of the worlds capitals of culture its no surprise that many museums here are free to explore! Tate Modern, National Gallery, Museum of London, and British Museum were just a few of my favourites I got the pleasure of touring while there. &#160; &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; Are you still patiently waiting for your letter from Hogwarts? Prepared to drop out of college to attend a school for witchcraft and wizardry? Me too! &#160; &#160; Being only an hour bus ride away from the Warner Bros. Studio Tour we just had to visit “The Making of Harry Potter”. This tour features costumes,  props, how special effects are used, facts about the actors and film crew, and complete movie sets from the filming of all 8 movies. Stepping into the studio tour was like stepping into the movies.  The tour starts off with a short film about the experience and the franchise and then the doors to the Great Hall are opened.  This massive set is decorated depending on the current season. For us, we went in October and were treated to a Halloween feast with the gold plates full and Jack-o-lanterns hanging from the enchanted ceiling. When you walk through the tour, there is everything from the &#8220;Sorting Hat&#8221; to the &#8220;Forbidden Forest&#8221;. The studio tour is all set up  for us muggles to explore! Here are some helpful tips to help you plan your magical getaway. &#160; &#160; Booking tickets in advance  Booking your tickets online in advance is required because they do not sell tickets at the door due to a limited number of visitors that can visit the Studio Tour at any one time. They do this to  ensure you have the best experience possible! Now if you are on exchange like us, chances are your school/ other students will run a trip here at least once a term so keep your eyes open! We went to the tour with a student-led group that had our travel and tickets covered for only £20.00, saving us nearly $50 CAN.

<p>Being only an hour bus ride away from the <a href="http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/">Warner Bros. Studio Tour</a> we just had to visit “The Making of Harry Potter”. This tour features costumes,  props, how special effects are used, facts about the actors and film crew, and complete movie sets from the filming of all 8 movies.</p>
<p>Stepping into the studio tour was like stepping into the movies.  The tour starts off with a short film about the experience and the franchise and then the doors to the Great Hall are opened.  This massive set is decorated depending on the current season. For us, we went in October and were treated to a Halloween feast with the gold plates full and Jack-o-lanterns hanging from the enchanted ceiling.</p>
<p>When you walk through the tour, there is everything from the &#8220;Sorting Hat&#8221; to the &#8220;Forbidden Forest&#8221;. The studio tour is all set up  for us muggles to explore! Here are some helpful tips to help you plan your magical getaway.</p>

<h2><b>Booking tickets in advance </b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/tickets">Booking your tickets online</a> in advance is required because they do not sell tickets at the door due to a limited number of visitors that can visit the Studio Tour at any one time. They do this to  ensure you have the best experience possible! Now if you are on exchange like us, chances are your school/ other students will run a trip here at least once a term so keep your eyes open! We went to the tour with a student-led group that had our travel and tickets covered for only £20.00, saving us nearly $50 CAN.</p>
<p>Standard Ticket Prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult (Ages 16 years and above) £41.00</li>
<li>Child (Ages 5 to 15 years) £33.00</li>
</ul>
<p>Group rates and family passes are also available.</p>
