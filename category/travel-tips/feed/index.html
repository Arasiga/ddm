				<description><![CDATA[<p>I had the amazing opportunity through my University&#8217;s co-op program to do an internship abroad for 4 months in Singapore. During my internship,  I didn&#8217;t get the leisure of traveling for more than a few days at a time. With some flexible work hours and a student budget, weekend getaways like this one to Hong Kong were still possible! This 3 day itinerary is great for anyone who may be doing a quick trip to Hong Kong or even if you are just looking for some inspiration for some activities to do that are on the cheaper side. &#160; &#160; I spent 3 days and 2 nights exploring the wonders this amazing city had to offer, and I think this was a good amount of time. Here&#8217;s how I did it! Day 1 Arrival A 3:30 am wake-up call is not as hard as it sounds when you are excited to be traveling. I had a 6:00 am flight which was great because I arrived early and could spend my day exploring the city. When I arrived it was around 11:00 am. I grabbed my Octopus card that I had pre-ordered online and headed out for my first adventure. Tip #1: Booking the Octopus card on Klook was only $14.65 CAD. It came pre-loaded with 50 HKD and no deposit fee. I also searched for promo codes online to get even more of a deal. &#160; Afternoon Ngong 360 cable cars is a great stop on your way to or from the airport because it&#8217;s only a 10 minute bus ride away! I decided take the cable cars right after landing in Hong Kong. To save some time, I kept my backpack with me for this part of the day and made sure to pack light so it wasn’t a bother. The gondola ride is a 25 minute trip up to Ngong Ping village where you can see Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Tip #2: Klook offers different packages for a discounted price, saving you about $5 CAD. More importantly, there is an express line for Klook pass holders that saved me an hour or two of waiting. &#160; &#160; After I finished walking around, I took a local bus (route 21) to Tai O a fishing village, a small area that is built on stilts. This was such a unique little community. I was on the fence about going but I&#8217;m so glad I went and saw it, I just wandered the streets and tried the different food stalls. Tip #3: Taking the bus only costs $1 CAD!! If you want to save some cash, I recommend taking the bus. &#160; Evening When I was done exploring, I headed back to Ngong Ping Village to catch the return gondola trip back down to the base. It was time to go check into the hostel and recharge. I stayed at YesInn Hostel near Causeway Bay which was a nice, social hostel. While sitting in the common area I met a few other travelers. We grabbed dinner and tried deep fried colon, it was surprisingly good! Tip #4: Look for small but busy restaurants to get delicious food for a cheap price. We found a small local restaurant that looked busy and got a sit down noodle dish for about $5 CAD.  To end the night, a few of us went to Lan Kwai Fong, the most popular nightlife area, and looked for happy hour deals. Tip #5: Stick to drinking only local beers to save money and avoid the expensive cocktail fees. &#160; Day 2 Morning To start my day off, I went on a Free Walking Tour I found online. This took up most of my morning and brought me all around the central area. I like walking tours because the guide gives you lots of insight into the history of the city and great travel tips from a local&#8217;s perspective. &#160; Afternoon In the afternoon I had time to grab lunch at a recommended Dim sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan. The line was massive so I opted for takeout instead. After eating lunch I went to Victoria Peak. I took the tram to the top and explored around the peak until I got to see the sun set over the hills. After the sunset, I went up to Peak Tower which was insanely busy at that time. I don’t recommend going at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. It was a nightmare, I couldn’t see a thing and it felt like such a waste of time. Tip #6: Use Klook to pre-book Victoria Peak tram and Sky Pass. I saved a few extra dollars and time because it gives you express entry &#8211; and trust me, on a weekend you&#8217;ll want that express entry if you don’t want to wait in the line for hours! &#160; Evening Symphony of Lights is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by Victoria Harbor, but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes. &#160; &#160; After the show, I went to Mr. Wong&#8217;s. This legendary place was recommended to me by a friend who did his exchange in Hong Kong. It is well known in the international students community and within travelers. Mr. Wong&#8217;s offers all you can eat Chinese buffet and all you can drink beers all night long! All of this for only $13 CAD. Day 3 Morning To make the most out of my last day, I woke up bright and early to make it to Dragons Back trail to do one last hike. Along the way, I stopped at the infamous building &#8220;montane mansions&#8221; to grab the Instagram worthy picture you always see. &#160; &#160; I walked the hike backwards starting from Chai Wan station and found the entrance using Google Maps. The hike took about 2 hours, but I took my time stopping to have my packed lunch at one of the lookout points (note: there are no refreshments along the way). Once I reached the end of the hike at the typical starting point in Shek O, I was able to easily catch a bus back to the MTR. &#160; Afternoon For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to Kowloon. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore. I started by getting off at Yau Ma Tei station and walked up through the Ladies Market. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine! From there I went up through the Goldfish Market which was so cool, there were pet stores lining each side of the street and fish just hanging in bags. I also made sure to stop at the Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens to take in the beautiful scenery. Tip #7: Remember to bargain and never take the original asking price because it is always hiked up! &#160; &#160; &#160; Before catching my flight I had one more stop, The Hong Kong Museum of History. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for FREE admission. After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling. &#160;</p>

<h3>Evening</h3>
<p><em>Symphony of Lights</em> is a nightly light show that runs at 8:00 pm every evening. The best place to watch it is by <em>Victoria Harbor,</em> but no need to rush there, if you just look up you can see the lasers shooting off the top of multiple buildings. Although it doesn’t quite compare to Singapore&#8217;s light show, it is nice to just sit down and relax for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-938 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="368" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening.jpg 4341w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-300x239.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-768x611.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/day2evening-1140x908.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>For the afternoon, I headed back to the hostel to collect my bag so I could head over to<em> Kowloon</em>. Kowloon is off the mainland and on the way to the airport so I brought my bag to make it easier before my flight back to Singapore.</p>
<p>I started by getting off at <em>Yau Ma Tei station</em> and walked up through the <em>Ladies Market</em>. Here you can find anything and everything you can imagine!

<p>Before catching my flight I had one more stop, <em>The</em> <em>Hong Kong Museum of History</em>. I spent my last few hours learning more about the culture and history of the island all for <strong>FREE</strong> admission.</p>
<p>After 3 days of early mornings and late nights I was exhausted and ready to get back! This weekend trip was the perfect amount of time to squeeze in a holiday on a working schedule and a wonderful place to get introduced into solo travelling.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Leaving the country for the first time for longer than your typical week vacation can be daunting. I can&#8217;t even imagine taking that first step without my best friend by my side. Seeing the world with my bestie has been such an amazing experience and here&#8217;s why&#8230; &#160; Helping with planning and making it fun Trip planning can be a difficult task for beginners like me. Having a friend help with the sometimes burdensome tasks of reading reviews when booking hostels, searching for the cheapest flight for the next destination, and planning your perfect itinerary can be a great advantage that can really take the load off trip planning. When you feel unsure or have doubts its helpful to have a second opinion. Plus, having someone to laugh and get excited with about the upcoming trip is always a bonus. &#160; &#160; Push each other to try new things Maybe you and your BFF aren&#8217;t necessarily the same person and may not see eye to eye at times. One of you may want to spend the day checking out museums while the other wants to rent bikes and explore the city. This can be good for when you are traveling. Having different interests may push you and your BFF to try new things and discoverer new shared interests. The most memorable parts of your trip will be the moments you stepped out of your comfort zone. &#160; &#160; You get to know everything about each other&#8230; and I really mean everything Spending day and night together for an extended period of time and basically sleeping on top of each other in hostels can put you to the test. You&#8217;ll get to know every little detail on their sleeping and eating habits you wouldn’t otherwise have known! You&#8217;ll basically become sisters by the end of your travels. &#160; &#160; Always have someone to take your next Instagram picture Have you ever asked a stranger to take a picture of you and gotten something you actually wanted to post? Yeah me neither. But having a friend who knows your angles can allow you to work it until you get the perfect shot. By the end of your trip your BFF will be brutally honest about your next Insta pic. &#160; &#160; Cheaper to travel with a friend It goes without saying, splitting the cost saves you money. It&#8217;s as simple as that. &#160; &#160; Guaranteed a good time at the bar There is nothing worse than being at the bar when your favorite summer song comes on and no one is around to sing it at the top of their lungs with you. Nightlife is a huge part of your 20&#8217;s so your student travel budget typically means finding the dingiest cheapest bars, keeping your head high and getting obliterated. Because as long as you and your friends are having fun who cares where you are. &#160; &#160; Forgot something? Forgot toothpaste, towel, or a hairbrush? Airport security took your shampoo? No need to fret! Chances are your BFF has got your back and will be willing to share. &#160; &#160; The memories never fade If you are lucky enough like me to go back to school with your friend, the adventures you have will be brought up over and over again. Telling the same stories over and over again will never get old &#8211; at least for us .. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is tired of hearing our travel stories. &#160; Grab your BFF, pick your destination, and get ready for the trip of a lifetime!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>London is known for its culture, style and history making this city one of the most visited in the world. Typically being pegged as one of the worlds most expensive cities, young backpackers may be intimidated by this beautiful city. Although pricey, it is also one of the best cities to explore and find fun, FREE activities to do. Here&#8217;s a list of a few of my favourite free things to do when exploring London: &#160; &#160; Sky garden  The famous enlarged glass dome showcases three stories of exquisitely landscaped public gardens and London’s most exclusive social spaces, including observation decks and an open air terrace. This space is free to the public as long as you reserve a time slot by booking a ticket online before you go. You can grab a bite to eat at the café or check out the Sky Bar while exploring the beautiful garden, we found this to be a great place to start our day off! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Platform 9 3/4  If you are a Harry Potter fan then you know that at King&#8217;s Cross Station, central London, platform 9 3/4  is kind of a big deal. The Harry Potter Shop at Platform 9 3/4 is filled with every magical artifact you can imagine and its free to look around and get your photo taken running to the Hogwarts Express! Huge Harry Potter fan and don&#8217;t mind spending a little? Check out our post on the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London &#8211; The Making of Harry Potter. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Markets  There is no better way to explore the city than wondering through and between London&#8217;s markets. Anything you are looking for can be found in one of the many markets scattered throughout the city. A few of my favourites were Camden,  Borough, and Portobello Markets. &#160; &#160; &#160; Tower Bridge Tower bridge is one of London&#8217;s must see landmarks and lucky for us its free to see! Spanning across the Thames river this magnificent architecture captures the hearts of many tourists, I know it took us over an hour to cross it because we were so amazed! (Actually because we were being basic and taking a lot of pictures) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Hyde Park Hyde Park is one of London’s eight Royal Parks and covers an area of 350 acres. Many events and activities are hosted here all throughout the year. Of course in the winter when I was here for the first time it was the famous &#8220;Christmas Extravaganza&#8221; Winter Wonderland! Definitely a must-see for winter travelers in London! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Big Ben  One of London&#8217;s most iconic tourist attraction is Big Ben, who stands beside the Houses of Parliament. This enormous clock tower which rarely falls silent (even standing strong during WWII), is currently silent until August 2021 while conservation work is done. &#160; &#160; &#160; The London EYE  Across the River Thames on the South Bank of the is another of London&#8217;s famous spots, Coca-Cola London EYE. This massive Ferris wheel is the tallest in Europe and is one of the cities best look out points. Unfortunately if you want to ride this attraction it will cost you, but if you are on a budget I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s still worth having a look at! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Changing of the Guards  This world-famous Changing of the Guards which takes place at Buckingham Palace is a must see for anyone in London. It doesn’t matter what time of the year you go, this event is guaranteed to bring a huge crowd so be prepared to peer between heads and stand on your tippy toes. This happens every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 11:00 am sharp! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Museums Being one of the worlds capitals of culture its no surprise that many museums here are free to explore! Tate Modern, National Gallery, Museum of London, and British Museum were just a few of my favourites I got the pleasure of touring while there. &#160; &#160;</p>

<h2><b>Markets </b></h2>
<p>There is no better way to explore the city than wondering through and between London&#8217;s markets. Anything you are looking for can be found in one of the many markets scattered throughout the city. A few of my favourites were</p>
<p>Camden,  Borough, and Portobello Markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Tower Bridge</b></h2>
<p>Tower bridge is one of London&#8217;s must see landmarks and lucky for us its free to see! Spanning across the Thames river this magnificent architecture captures the hearts of many tourists, I know it took us over an hour to cross it because we were so amazed! (Actually because we were being basic and taking a lot of pictures)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Hyde Park</b></h2>
<p>Hyde Park is one of London’s <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks">eight Royal Parks</a> and covers an area of 350 acres. Many events and activities are hosted here all throughout the year. Of course in the winter when I was here for the first time it was the famous &#8220;Christmas Extravaganza&#8221; <a href="http://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/">Winter Wonderland</a>! Definitely a must-see for winter travelers in London!</p>

<h2><b>Big Ben </b></h2>
<p>One of London&#8217;s most iconic tourist attraction is Big Ben, who stands beside the Houses of Parliament. This enormous clock tower which rarely falls silent (even standing strong during WWII), is currently silent until August 2021 while conservation work is done.</p>

<h2><b>The London EYE </b></h2>
<p>Across the River Thames on the South Bank of the is another of London&#8217;s famous spots, Coca-Cola London EYE. This massive Ferris wheel is the tallest in Europe and is one of the cities best look out points. Unfortunately if you want to ride this attraction it will cost you, but if you are on a budget I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s still worth having a look at!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>So the flight is booked, and in a few weeks, months, or days you&#8217;ll be landing in Europe ready to begin your adventure! Here are our 10 tips for traveling Europe: &#160; 1. Travel in the off season  Dreaming of picnicking at the base of the Eiffel tower this summer? You are not alone there, summer is the busiest time to travel Europe. Avoid the summer months if you want to avoid long queues and large crowds. European tourist attractions can be a mess during peak season. Traveling off season will save you time and money! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Do as the locals do Try and blend in with the locals, don’t  stand out as an obnoxious tourist with bad manners. Be aware of your surroundings and try to follow what the locals do: grab a beer (doesn&#8217;t matter what time) or watch the local sport match. &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Travel by train Travelling by train may be more efficient and easier than air travel when exploring Europe. There are lots of options when it comes to booking your tickets: you can do it in person, at a kiosk, online, or use a rail planner app. You can also find deals and sales when it comes to using a Eurail pass. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Use budget airlines In Europe there&#8217;s no shortage of budget airlines with companies such as Ryanair or easyJet. Travelling around Europe by plane can be faster and sometimes even be cheaper. Airfares can often be cheaper than a train ticket if you book in advance, travel in the middle of the week, and pay attention to additional fees. Packing light or taking just a carry on will help you avoid additional fees! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Wear comfortable shoes One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must! &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Carry cash  While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash. &#160; &#160; 7. Stay longer in one place Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax! &#160; &#160; &#160; 8. Wonder off the beaten path I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9. Stay central  Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 10. Free city walking tours Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars! &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>5. Wear comfortable shoes</b></h2>
<p>One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-823 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="306" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2.jpg 5184w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa5-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>6. Carry cash </b></h2>
<p>While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-410 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa3-2-e1534307333622.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="328" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>7. Stay longer in one place</b></h2>
<p>Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-819 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="344" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2.jpg 4456w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-300x224.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-768x574.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2f9c-2-1140x853.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>8. Wonder off the beaten path</b></h2>
<p>I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-825 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="306" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1.jpg 5182w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0812-1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>9. Stay central </b></h2>
<p>Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-822 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="307" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2.jpg 5184w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fullsizeoutput_2fa4-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>10. Free city walking tours</b></h2>
<p>Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF) is a night where thousands of edm (electric dance music) lovers from all walks of life, come together united by music. AMF falls at the heart of one of dance music’s most integral conference, the Amsterdam Dance Event during mid October. Together: We Own The Night. Getting tickets This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else! Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours! Finding accommodation When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night. Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at Hostelle (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue! Getting there As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage! But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing. Proper footwear Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared. Planning a fire outfit There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave. As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show. Hydration The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this! Don&#8217;t lose your friends Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated. Safe drug use AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue. This being said, illicit substances are still commonly seen within the crowd. So if you do choose to partake be sure you know what exactly you are taking and be aware of your surroundings. Respect the rules Every festival has its own set of rules so make sure you familiarize yourself with the list of do&#8217;s and don’ts before going. A helpful page is the FAQ section which can be found here: https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, this one is for you:  now we are all about equality and feminism but sometimes you just have to work with what you were given, and that’s not a bad thing! We are going to give you some of our best tips for going out on the town without spending any money. Do your research Exploring a city for the first time and not sure where to go?  There are tones of online resources available to help you find exactly the kind of night you are looking for. For example, DesignMyNight is a good one we used every time we went out in the UK. We found this great place in London, Ballie Ballerson, that has a fun ball pit to play at the bar! Use social media Once you got a few names from this search head over to the bar/club&#8217;s Facebook or other social media to see if they have any events running and past reviews on their site. Keep in mind, when reading reviews a lot will be negative as more people tend to write a review after having a bad experience rather than after having a great night. Guest list From the bars website or over Facebook, look for a bar with guest list which usually gets you in for free and sometimes even skip the line. All it takes is submitting your name through a quick message to their Facebook or submitting a form online. When you do this, typically you have to go early and the bar may be dead when you arrive but trust me, it will pick up! It&#8217;s totally worth it if you don&#8217;t want to pay for cover. Keep your eyes open Most people will tell you to walk with your head up, but I&#8217;m going to tell you the opposite. Because if you keep your head down and your eyes open then there&#8217;s a better chance you will be the lucky one to find that $10 bill (or whatever currency the country you&#8217;re in uses) on the ground.  Trust me, there&#8217;s no better feeling then finding that bill and running straight to the bar for drinks! Free drinks Drinks are always good, but free drinks are even better. Just be aware when getting drinks from strangers at the bar. Never accept a drink you didn&#8217;t see the bar tender make as unfortunate as it is, it is so easy for someone to slip something in it Find the bottles Bottle service is your friend. So many good nights we&#8217;ve had by meeting groups with bottle service there to celebrate. Especially as a traveler, meeting new people is what it&#8217;s all about …. And maybe you&#8217;ll get a free drink after the introduction. Bring the bottles That sparkly flask your friends got you for your 19th birthday, well now is the time to use it. Now almost all bars don’t allow outside drinks so you know… don&#8217;t get caught. And when you need chase to wash down your shots ask for a lemon slice over paying for chase, they&#8217;re free.</p>
