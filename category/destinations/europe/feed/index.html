				<description><![CDATA[<p>So the flight is booked, and in a few weeks, months, or days you&#8217;ll be landing in Europe ready to begin your adventure! Here are our 10 tips for traveling Europe: &#160; 1. Travel in the off season  Dreaming of picnicking at the base of the Eiffel tower this summer? You are not alone there, summer is the busiest time to travel Europe. Avoid the summer months if you want to avoid long queues and large crowds. European tourist attractions can be a mess during peak season. Traveling off season will save you time and money! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Do as the locals do Try and blend in with the locals, don’t  stand out as an obnoxious tourist with bad manners. Be aware of your surroundings and try to follow what the locals do: grab a beer (doesn&#8217;t matter what time) or watch the local sport match. &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Travel by train Travelling by train may be more efficient and easier than air travel when exploring Europe. There are lots of options when it comes to booking your tickets: you can do it in person, at a kiosk, online, or use a rail planner app. You can also find deals and sales when it comes to using a Eurail pass. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Use budget airlines In Europe there&#8217;s no shortage of budget airlines with companies such as Ryanair or easyJet. Travelling around Europe by plane can be faster and sometimes even be cheaper. Airfares can often be cheaper than a train ticket if you book in advance, travel in the middle of the week, and pay attention to additional fees. Packing light or taking just a carry on will help you avoid additional fees! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Wear comfortable shoes One of the best ways to explore any city is to walk everywhere! Long days venturing from attraction to attraction will have feet and back aching if you aren&#8217;t wearing comfortable walking shoes, these are a must! &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Carry cash  While you don&#8217;t want to carry all your cash on you, you don’t want to rely only on credit cards as it is not uncommon for a place in Europe to only accept cash. Many small local business, restaurants, markets or taxis will only take cash. &#160; &#160; 7. Stay longer in one place Staying in one place longer will allow you to experience the city more like a local and get to know the neighborhood. You&#8217;ll have a chance to meet more people and find your favourite spots in the city. Staying put also means less packing and unpacking and more time to explore and relax! &#160; &#160; &#160; 8. Wonder off the beaten path I mean you&#8217;re not, not going to see the Eiffel Tower when in Paris but sometimes in your free time seeing the lesser known side of a city can be just as rewarding. Talk to locals they&#8217;ll have the inside scoop on all the best places to check out! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9. Stay central  Although accommodation may be a bit more pricey its worth the extra cost to easily get to all the best attractions the city center has to offer. You&#8217;ll be able to find bars and restaurants much easier and avoid the hassle of transportation if you stay central.  If you want to stay a little bit outside of the central area, make sure public transportation is available near by. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 10. Free city walking tours Almost every major city has started to offer &#8220;Free Walking Tours&#8221; this concept allows you to take the tour then tip the tour guide an amount that you see fit. The tour guides are almost always very personable and knowledgeable. They will give you some interesting insight on the local history and anecdotes. The tour guides are also excellent locals to ask about cheap eats and the best bars! &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF) is a night where thousands of edm (electric dance music) lovers from all walks of life, come together united by music. AMF falls at the heart of one of dance music’s most integral conference, the Amsterdam Dance Event during mid October. Together: We Own The Night. Getting tickets This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else! Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours! Finding accommodation When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night. Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at Hostelle (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue! Getting there As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage! But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing. Proper footwear Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared. Planning a fire outfit There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave. As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show. Hydration The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this! Don&#8217;t lose your friends Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated. Safe drug use AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF) is a night where thousands of edm (electric dance music) lovers from all walks of life, come together united by music. AMF falls at the heart of one of dance music’s most integral conference, the Amsterdam Dance Event during mid October.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Together: We Own The Night.</em></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-483 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="552" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<h2><b>Getting tickets</b></h2>
<p>This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else!</p>
<p>Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-487 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Finding accommodation</b></h2>
<p>When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night.</p>
<p>Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at <a href="https://www.hostelle.com/">Hostelle</a> (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-489 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="322" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-300x210.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-768x538.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-86x60.jpg 86w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Getting there</b></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage!</p>
<p>But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-486 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="329" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-300x214.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-768x549.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-84x60.jpg 84w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Proper footwear</b></h2>
<p>Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-488 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Planning a fire outfit</b></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-485 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="431" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-300x281.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-768x720.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-64x60.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Hydration </b></h2>
<p>The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this!</p>
<h2><b>Don&#8217;t lose your friends </b></h2>
<p>Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated.</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-484 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></h2>
<h2><b>Safe drug use</b></h2>
<p>AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue.</p>
<p>This being said, illicit substances are still commonly seen within the crowd. So if you do choose to partake be sure you know what exactly you are taking and be aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-490 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="389" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-300x254.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-768x650.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-71x60.jpg 71w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Respect the rules </b></h2>
<p>Every festival has its own set of rules so make sure you familiarize yourself with the list of do&#8217;s and don’ts before going. A helpful page is the FAQ section which can be found here: <a href="https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/">https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/</a></p>
