				<description><![CDATA[<p>October is finally here which means it&#8217;s almost Halloween!! Whether you and your friends spend the holiday partying it up, going to haunted houses, or watching scary movies the biggest thing on everyone&#8217;s mind is what your Halloween costume will be. For many university/college students in Canada, this one day event is more often turned into a week-long affair. This means buying multiple expensive costumes is out of the question. Lucky for you we&#8217;ve got some tips and ideas to help you put together the perfect DIY costume that&#8217;s cheap, easy, and everyone&#8217;s going to love. Plan ahead I know this is something most of us students struggle with, but if you have a costume idea ahead of time you can take your time looking out for the perfect pieces to put it all together. No last minute runs to the dollar store only to find out they&#8217;ve run out of cat ears. A few years back my friends and I were very original and wanted to be Victoria Secret angels so we planned months in advance and got silk robes online from Amazon for only a few dollars, rather than spending $30+ in store. If you already own a silk robe and lingerie, all you need is some angel wings and you&#8217;ve got yourself a Halloween costume. &#160; &#160; Use what you have The best way to save money is not to spend anything at all! Have an old jersey in your closet or even your brothers closet, nothing says quick and easy costume better than an athlete. Take advantage of household items Get creative. Don’t have time to shop? No problem! with only a few sheets of newspaper and a jacket you&#8217;ve got a … news flash!! No newspaper? Don&#8217;t stress! Newspaper can be found for free at almost any street corner. No purchases necessary. &#160; &#160; Borrow from friends Don’t have anything lying around at home you can use (doubtful)? I bet your friends just might. Recycle old costumes and add your own personal touch. Back when &#8220;Despicable me&#8221; first came out I knew I just had to be minion (basic, I know). I saw my friend posted a picture in cute overalls and knew they would be perfect so I borrowed them for the night, added some personal touches and it ended up being a great costume. Be witty It&#8217;s so satisfying getting compliment on your costume that you only put some minor effort into. With a little creativity pulling together a great look for less has never been more rewarding. Here we all are as beanie babies &#8211; a cute twist to the basic animal ear costume every girl has done at least once. &#160; &#160; Do you Try and think outside the box, what makes you, you? thinking of a costume is much easier when you think about what you love and make it come to life. For Alicia and I, wine is our one true love so what better costumes than being a couple of wine boxes. All we did was find a burgundy body suit (easy and spent less than $10, which we still wear regularly), some plastic cellophane, and printed out our favorite wine label. &#160; &#160; Group costumes Group costumes are always fun to plan with your friends and makes it easier with more people brainstorming ideas. You&#8217;re bound to come up with something good! Here we are in first year as the Mario party squad each getting our costumes for under $10. &#160;</p>

<h1>Use what you have</h1>
<p>The best way to save money is not to spend anything at all! Have an old jersey in your closet or even your brothers closet, nothing says quick and easy costume better than an athlete.</p>
<h1>Take advantage of household items</h1>
<p>Get creative. Don’t have time to shop? No problem! with only a few sheets of newspaper and a jacket you&#8217;ve got a … news flash!! No newspaper? Don&#8217;t stress! Newspaper can be found for free at almost any street corner. No purchases necessary.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, this one is for you:  now we are all about equality and feminism but sometimes you just have to work with what you were given, and that’s not a bad thing! We are going to give you some of our best tips for going out on the town without spending any money. Do your research Exploring a city for the first time and not sure where to go?  There are tones of online resources available to help you find exactly the kind of night you are looking for. For example, DesignMyNight is a good one we used every time we went out in the UK. We found this great place in London, Ballie Ballerson, that has a fun ball pit to play at the bar! Use social media Once you got a few names from this search head over to the bar/club&#8217;s Facebook or other social media to see if they have any events running and past reviews on their site. Keep in mind, when reading reviews a lot will be negative as more people tend to write a review after having a bad experience rather than after having a great night. Guest list From the bars website or over Facebook, look for a bar with guest list which usually gets you in for free and sometimes even skip the line. All it takes is submitting your name through a quick message to their Facebook or submitting a form online. When you do this, typically you have to go early and the bar may be dead when you arrive but trust me, it will pick up! It&#8217;s totally worth it if you don&#8217;t want to pay for cover. Keep your eyes open Most people will tell you to walk with your head up, but I&#8217;m going to tell you the opposite. Because if you keep your head down and your eyes open then there&#8217;s a better chance you will be the lucky one to find that $10 bill (or whatever currency the country you&#8217;re in uses) on the ground.  Trust me, there&#8217;s no better feeling then finding that bill and running straight to the bar for drinks! Free drinks Drinks are always good, but free drinks are even better. Just be aware when getting drinks from strangers at the bar. Never accept a drink you didn&#8217;t see the bar tender make as unfortunate as it is, it is so easy for someone to slip something in it Find the bottles Bottle service is your friend. So many good nights we&#8217;ve had by meeting groups with bottle service there to celebrate. Especially as a traveler, meeting new people is what it&#8217;s all about …. And maybe you&#8217;ll get a free drink after the introduction. Bring the bottles That sparkly flask your friends got you for your 19th birthday, well now is the time to use it. Now almost all bars don’t allow outside drinks so you know… don&#8217;t get caught. And when you need chase to wash down your shots ask for a lemon slice over paying for chase, they&#8217;re free.</p>
