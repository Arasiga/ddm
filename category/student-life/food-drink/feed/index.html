				<description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, this one is for you:  now we are all about equality and feminism but sometimes you just have to work with what you were given, and that’s not a bad thing! We are going to give you some of our best tips for going out on the town without spending any money. Do your research Exploring a city for the first time and not sure where to go?  There are tones of online resources available to help you find exactly the kind of night you are looking for. For example, DesignMyNight is a good one we used every time we went out in the UK. We found this great place in London, Ballie Ballerson, that has a fun ball pit to play at the bar! Use social media Once you got a few names from this search head over to the bar/club&#8217;s Facebook or other social media to see if they have any events running and past reviews on their site. Keep in mind, when reading reviews a lot will be negative as more people tend to write a review after having a bad experience rather than after having a great night. Guest list From the bars website or over Facebook, look for a bar with guest list which usually gets you in for free and sometimes even skip the line. All it takes is submitting your name through a quick message to their Facebook or submitting a form online. When you do this, typically you have to go early and the bar may be dead when you arrive but trust me, it will pick up! It&#8217;s totally worth it if you don&#8217;t want to pay for cover. Keep your eyes open Most people will tell you to walk with your head up, but I&#8217;m going to tell you the opposite. Because if you keep your head down and your eyes open then there&#8217;s a better chance you will be the lucky one to find that $10 bill (or whatever currency the country you&#8217;re in uses) on the ground.  Trust me, there&#8217;s no better feeling then finding that bill and running straight to the bar for drinks! Free drinks Drinks are always good, but free drinks are even better. Just be aware when getting drinks from strangers at the bar. Never accept a drink you didn&#8217;t see the bar tender make as unfortunate as it is, it is so easy for someone to slip something in it Find the bottles Bottle service is your friend. So many good nights we&#8217;ve had by meeting groups with bottle service there to celebrate. Especially as a traveler, meeting new people is what it&#8217;s all about …. And maybe you&#8217;ll get a free drink after the introduction. Bring the bottles That sparkly flask your friends got you for your 19th birthday, well now is the time to use it. Now almost all bars don’t allow outside drinks so you know… don&#8217;t get caught. And when you need chase to wash down your shots ask for a lemon slice over paying for chase, they&#8217;re free.</p>
