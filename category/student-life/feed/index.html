				<description><![CDATA[<p>October is finally here which means it&#8217;s almost Halloween!! Whether you and your friends spend the holiday partying it up, going to haunted houses, or watching scary movies the biggest thing on everyone&#8217;s mind is what your Halloween costume will be. For many university/college students in Canada, this one day event is more often turned into a week-long affair. This means buying multiple expensive costumes is out of the question. Lucky for you we&#8217;ve got some tips and ideas to help you put together the perfect DIY costume that&#8217;s cheap, easy, and everyone&#8217;s going to love. Plan ahead I know this is something most of us students struggle with, but if you have a costume idea ahead of time you can take your time looking out for the perfect pieces to put it all together. No last minute runs to the dollar store only to find out they&#8217;ve run out of cat ears. A few years back my friends and I were very original and wanted to be Victoria Secret angels so we planned months in advance and got silk robes online from Amazon for only a few dollars, rather than spending $30+ in store. If you already own a silk robe and lingerie, all you need is some angel wings and you&#8217;ve got yourself a Halloween costume. &#160; &#160; Use what you have The best way to save money is not to spend anything at all! Have an old jersey in your closet or even your brothers closet, nothing says quick and easy costume better than an athlete. Take advantage of household items Get creative. Don’t have time to shop? No problem! with only a few sheets of newspaper and a jacket you&#8217;ve got a … news flash!! No newspaper? Don&#8217;t stress! Newspaper can be found for free at almost any street corner. No purchases necessary. &#160; &#160; Borrow from friends Don’t have anything lying around at home you can use (doubtful)? I bet your friends just might. Recycle old costumes and add your own personal touch. Back when &#8220;Despicable me&#8221; first came out I knew I just had to be minion (basic, I know). I saw my friend posted a picture in cute overalls and knew they would be perfect so I borrowed them for the night, added some personal touches and it ended up being a great costume. Be witty It&#8217;s so satisfying getting compliment on your costume that you only put some minor effort into. With a little creativity pulling together a great look for less has never been more rewarding. Here we all are as beanie babies &#8211; a cute twist to the basic animal ear costume every girl has done at least once. &#160; &#160; Do you Try and think outside the box, what makes you, you? thinking of a costume is much easier when you think about what you love and make it come to life. For Alicia and I, wine is our one true love so what better costumes than being a couple of wine boxes. All we did was find a burgundy body suit (easy and spent less than $10, which we still wear regularly), some plastic cellophane, and printed out our favorite wine label. &#160; &#160; Group costumes Group costumes are always fun to plan with your friends and makes it easier with more people brainstorming ideas. You&#8217;re bound to come up with something good! Here we are in first year as the Mario party squad each getting our costumes for under $10. &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Leaving the country for the first time for longer than your typical week vacation can be daunting. I can&#8217;t even imagine taking that first step without my best friend by my side. Seeing the world with my bestie has been such an amazing experience and here&#8217;s why&#8230; &#160; Helping with planning and making it fun Trip planning can be a difficult task for beginners like me. Having a friend help with the sometimes burdensome tasks of reading reviews when booking hostels, searching for the cheapest flight for the next destination, and planning your perfect itinerary can be a great advantage that can really take the load off trip planning. When you feel unsure or have doubts its helpful to have a second opinion. Plus, having someone to laugh and get excited with about the upcoming trip is always a bonus. &#160; &#160; Push each other to try new things Maybe you and your BFF aren&#8217;t necessarily the same person and may not see eye to eye at times. One of you may want to spend the day checking out museums while the other wants to rent bikes and explore the city. This can be good for when you are traveling. Having different interests may push you and your BFF to try new things and discoverer new shared interests. The most memorable parts of your trip will be the moments you stepped out of your comfort zone. &#160; &#160; You get to know everything about each other&#8230; and I really mean everything Spending day and night together for an extended period of time and basically sleeping on top of each other in hostels can put you to the test. You&#8217;ll get to know every little detail on their sleeping and eating habits you wouldn’t otherwise have known! You&#8217;ll basically become sisters by the end of your travels. &#160; &#160; Always have someone to take your next Instagram picture Have you ever asked a stranger to take a picture of you and gotten something you actually wanted to post? Yeah me neither. But having a friend who knows your angles can allow you to work it until you get the perfect shot. By the end of your trip your BFF will be brutally honest about your next Insta pic. &#160; &#160; Cheaper to travel with a friend It goes without saying, splitting the cost saves you money. It&#8217;s as simple as that. &#160; &#160; Guaranteed a good time at the bar There is nothing worse than being at the bar when your favorite summer song comes on and no one is around to sing it at the top of their lungs with you. Nightlife is a huge part of your 20&#8217;s so your student travel budget typically means finding the dingiest cheapest bars, keeping your head high and getting obliterated. Because as long as you and your friends are having fun who cares where you are. &#160; &#160; Forgot something? Forgot toothpaste, towel, or a hairbrush? Airport security took your shampoo? No need to fret! Chances are your BFF has got your back and will be willing to share. &#160; &#160; The memories never fade If you are lucky enough like me to go back to school with your friend, the adventures you have will be brought up over and over again. Telling the same stories over and over again will never get old &#8211; at least for us .. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is tired of hearing our travel stories. &#160; Grab your BFF, pick your destination, and get ready for the trip of a lifetime!</p>

<p>Forgot toothpaste, towel, or a hairbrush? Airport security took your shampoo? No need to fret! Chances are your BFF has got your back and will be willing to share.</p>

<h1>The memories never fade</h1>
<p>If you are lucky enough like me to go back to school with your friend, the adventures you have will be brought up over and over again. Telling the same stories over and over again will never get old &#8211; at least for us .. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is tired of hearing our travel stories.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Want to embark on your own adventure? Create memories that will last a lifetime? Step outside of what you are used to and immerse yourself in a new culture! Fall 2017 we went to the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom for a study term abroad, and it changed our lives!  Here are ten reasons why studying abroad is SO worth it! &#160; &#160; 1. Make new friends from around the world Remember how exciting those first few weeks of a new school were? When everyone is friendly and open to meeting new people? Whether you are living in residence with the locals or in a global community with other international students, everyone is starting from scratch. People from all over may be your new flatmates, classmates, or friends in a club/society, either way going aboard is guaranteed to expand your social circle. With the ever expanding social media its easy to stay in touch! &#160; 2. See the world  By studying abroad you will see parts of the world like you haven&#8217;t before. You&#8217;ll get to experience a new country and all it has to offer from its culture to customs. Not only will you be immersed in your host city but getting to your neighboring countries and cities couldn&#8217;t be easier. Abroad in England? We took a 5 pound flight one-way to Dublin for a weekend and a 4 hour train to get across the entirety of Ireland. 3. Add it to your Résumé  Whether you are looking to further your education or jump into a career, going aboard will give you a competitive edge to stand out. Studying abroad shows commitment to your education, a desire to learn, and a curiosity that will be hard to beat! Graduate schools and employers look for these skills for new leaders in any field of study. &#160; &#160; 4. Experience life outside of your comfort zone  You are leaving behind everything that you know and are comfortable with, you&#8217;ll find yourself over coming a new situation everyday. Being in a new country puts yourself out there, you&#8217;ll take risks, get lost, try new things, and learn from each experience! &#160; &#160; 5. You&#8217;ll see your own culture from a new view Taking a step back from everything you know gives you a new view on life. A new perspective may help you learn things about your own culture and country you never thought of before. &#8220;Am I American? ARE YOU CRAZY I&#8217;M A CANADIAN, EH…&#8221; Let&#8217;s just say it made me patriotic as f***. Go Canada Go. 6. Self-discovery Leaving your home and everyone you know behind means you will have to rely on yourself. In no time you&#8217;ll be able to find your passions and your interest as you frolic new countries and embark on new adventures. This adventure of a life time will give you freedom and independence along the way. You will feel so empowered by the end! &#160; &#160; 7. Discover new and exciting food and drinks With each new country means a new food and drinks to try (best part)! Everything from eating out, to grocery shopping and cooking in a hostel will be new and you&#8217;ll discover new foods, ingredients, and recipes along the way! Did you know pumpkin pie is unheard of in the UK?! So don&#8217;t go looking for that this Thanksgiving. &#160; &#160; 8. Learn to appreciate the smaller things  Packing for 4 months of your life into one suit case can be a daunting task. Living without the comforts of the little things, like having more then two pairs of shoes to choose from, makes us realize some of the things we take for granted. &#160; &#160; 9. Get to know a new culture  Studying abroad immerses you in a new culture&#8217;s atmosphere, activities, politics, and sometimes even language(s). This deepens your understanding of the world and helps you become more empathetic. There is so much of the world to explore and doing it in person versus through a screen is one experience you wont want to miss. &#160; 10. You&#8217;re not visiting, you&#8217;re living  Navigating your university&#8217;s city like a local, you&#8217;ll discover all the hidden gems like the best cafés, bars, restaurants and more. What feels so foreign at first becomes so familiar and eventually you&#8217;ll find yourself a second home. You&#8217;ll be sad to leave! &#160;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF) is a night where thousands of edm (electric dance music) lovers from all walks of life, come together united by music. AMF falls at the heart of one of dance music’s most integral conference, the Amsterdam Dance Event during mid October. Together: We Own The Night. Getting tickets This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else! Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours! Finding accommodation When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night. Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at Hostelle (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue! Getting there As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage! But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing. Proper footwear Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared. Planning a fire outfit There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave. As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show. Hydration The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this! Don&#8217;t lose your friends Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated. Safe drug use AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue. This being said, illicit substances are still commonly seen within the crowd. So if you do choose to partake be sure you know what exactly you are taking and be aware of your surroundings. Respect the rules Every festival has its own set of rules so make sure you familiarize yourself with the list of do&#8217;s and don’ts before going. A helpful page is the FAQ section which can be found here: https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/</p>

<p><img class="wp-image-483 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="552" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Amsterdam-Music-Festival-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<h2><b>Getting tickets</b></h2>
<p>This is the most important step committing you to the best night of your life. Pre-register with your email at any time before tickets go on sale and this will allow you to be the first to get tickets to the next AMF, get you tickets at the lowest price possible and know about all the sales and line-up before anyone else!</p>
<p>Then all you have to do when tickets go on sale is grab yours!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-487 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-Tickets-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Finding accommodation</b></h2>
<p>When buying your ticket there is the option to book a hotel through AMF but if you are a fellow struggling student I don’t suggest this option, these hotels can range from €100 to €250+ per night.</p>
<p>Instead we recommend booking a hostel in advance! We stayed at <a href="https://www.hostelle.com/">Hostelle</a> (all female hostel, sorry boys!) for only €40 a night and it was a 10 minute walk to the venue!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-489 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="322" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-300x210.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-768x538.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Respect-the-Rules-86x60.jpg 86w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Getting there</b></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we just ran to the venue 10 minutes before our first fav DJ took to the stage!</p>
<p>But getting to the venue couldn’t be easier. It&#8217;s held at the Amsterdam ArenA which is right between Strandvliet and Bijlmer Arena metro stations. Or of course taxis and Ubers are always an option but you may want to book in advance since a lot of other festival goers will be thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-486 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="329" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-300x214.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-768x549.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Getting-There-84x60.jpg 84w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Proper footwear</b></h2>
<p>Now as much as you want to wear those cute shoes you just got that match your outfit perfectly, unless those shoes are a supportive pair of sneakers… DON’T DO IT. Wear comfortable shoes, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, your feet and back will thank me later. With hours of jumping and raging into the night ahead of you, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-488 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Proper-Footwear-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Planning a fire outfit</b></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s not much advice I can give here other then, anything goes! So let your personality shine, be wild and express yourself any way you see fit! It&#8217;s impossible to wear the wrong outfit to a rave.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below we really let our sparkling personalities show.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-485 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="431" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-300x281.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-768x720.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fire-Outfit-64x60.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Hydration </b></h2>
<p>The most important thing to remember is to STAY HYDRATED . You&#8217;ll be dancing, a lot, and possibly drinking and some other fun things but always remember your health comes first and drinking water plays a huge role in this!</p>
<h2><b>Don&#8217;t lose your friends </b></h2>
<p>Sounds silly to say this but in a crowd of thousands it&#8217;s defiantly possible. Often at these events cell service isn&#8217;t reliable so it&#8217;s a good idea to designate a meeting spot when you arrive in case you get separated.</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-484 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="345" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-768x576.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dont-lose-your-Friends-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></h2>
<h2><b>Safe drug use</b></h2>
<p>AMF conducts an absolute zero tolerance policy. If it is suspected that you have drugs on you, you will be denied entrance to the festival or removed from the venue.</p>
<p>This being said, illicit substances are still commonly seen within the crowd. So if you do choose to partake be sure you know what exactly you are taking and be aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-490 aligncenter" src="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="389" srcset="https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe.jpg 1024w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-300x254.jpg 300w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-768x650.jpg 768w, https://arasiga.github.io/ddm/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Safe-Drug-USe-71x60.jpg 71w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<h2><b>Respect the rules </b></h2>
<p>Every festival has its own set of rules so make sure you familiarize yourself with the list of do&#8217;s and don’ts before going. A helpful page is the FAQ section which can be found here: <a href="https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/">https://amf-festival.com/nl/faq/general/</a></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, this one is for you:  now we are all about equality and feminism but sometimes you just have to work with what you were given, and that’s not a bad thing! We are going to give you some of our best tips for going out on the town without spending any money. Do your research Exploring a city for the first time and not sure where to go?  There are tones of online resources available to help you find exactly the kind of night you are looking for. For example, DesignMyNight is a good one we used every time we went out in the UK. We found this great place in London, Ballie Ballerson, that has a fun ball pit to play at the bar! Use social media Once you got a few names from this search head over to the bar/club&#8217;s Facebook or other social media to see if they have any events running and past reviews on their site. Keep in mind, when reading reviews a lot will be negative as more people tend to write a review after having a bad experience rather than after having a great night. Guest list From the bars website or over Facebook, look for a bar with guest list which usually gets you in for free and sometimes even skip the line. All it takes is submitting your name through a quick message to their Facebook or submitting a form online. When you do this, typically you have to go early and the bar may be dead when you arrive but trust me, it will pick up! It&#8217;s totally worth it if you don&#8217;t want to pay for cover. Keep your eyes open Most people will tell you to walk with your head up, but I&#8217;m going to tell you the opposite. Because if you keep your head down and your eyes open then there&#8217;s a better chance you will be the lucky one to find that $10 bill (or whatever currency the country you&#8217;re in uses) on the ground.  Trust me, there&#8217;s no better feeling then finding that bill and running straight to the bar for drinks! Free drinks Drinks are always good, but free drinks are even better. Just be aware when getting drinks from strangers at the bar. Never accept a drink you didn&#8217;t see the bar tender make as unfortunate as it is, it is so easy for someone to slip something in it Find the bottles Bottle service is your friend. So many good nights we&#8217;ve had by meeting groups with bottle service there to celebrate. Especially as a traveler, meeting new people is what it&#8217;s all about …. And maybe you&#8217;ll get a free drink after the introduction. Bring the bottles That sparkly flask your friends got you for your 19th birthday, well now is the time to use it. Now almost all bars don’t allow outside drinks so you know… don&#8217;t get caught. And when you need chase to wash down your shots ask for a lemon slice over paying for chase, they&#8217;re free.</p>
