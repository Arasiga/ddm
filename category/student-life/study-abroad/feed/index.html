				<description><![CDATA[<p>Leaving the country for the first time for longer than your typical week vacation can be daunting. I can&#8217;t even imagine taking that first step without my best friend by my side. Seeing the world with my bestie has been such an amazing experience and here&#8217;s why&#8230; &#160; Helping with planning and making it fun Trip planning can be a difficult task for beginners like me. Having a friend help with the sometimes burdensome tasks of reading reviews when booking hostels, searching for the cheapest flight for the next destination, and planning your perfect itinerary can be a great advantage that can really take the load off trip planning. When you feel unsure or have doubts its helpful to have a second opinion. Plus, having someone to laugh and get excited with about the upcoming trip is always a bonus. &#160; &#160; Push each other to try new things Maybe you and your BFF aren&#8217;t necessarily the same person and may not see eye to eye at times. One of you may want to spend the day checking out museums while the other wants to rent bikes and explore the city. This can be good for when you are traveling. Having different interests may push you and your BFF to try new things and discoverer new shared interests. The most memorable parts of your trip will be the moments you stepped out of your comfort zone. &#160; &#160; You get to know everything about each other&#8230; and I really mean everything Spending day and night together for an extended period of time and basically sleeping on top of each other in hostels can put you to the test. You&#8217;ll get to know every little detail on their sleeping and eating habits you wouldn’t otherwise have known! You&#8217;ll basically become sisters by the end of your travels. &#160; &#160; Always have someone to take your next Instagram picture Have you ever asked a stranger to take a picture of you and gotten something you actually wanted to post? Yeah me neither. But having a friend who knows your angles can allow you to work it until you get the perfect shot. By the end of your trip your BFF will be brutally honest about your next Insta pic. &#160; &#160; Cheaper to travel with a friend It goes without saying, splitting the cost saves you money. It&#8217;s as simple as that. &#160; &#160; Guaranteed a good time at the bar There is nothing worse than being at the bar when your favorite summer song comes on and no one is around to sing it at the top of their lungs with you. Nightlife is a huge part of your 20&#8217;s so your student travel budget typically means finding the dingiest cheapest bars, keeping your head high and getting obliterated. Because as long as you and your friends are having fun who cares where you are. &#160; &#160; Forgot something? Forgot toothpaste, towel, or a hairbrush? Airport security took your shampoo? No need to fret! Chances are your BFF has got your back and will be willing to share. &#160; &#160; The memories never fade If you are lucky enough like me to go back to school with your friend, the adventures you have will be brought up over and over again. Telling the same stories over and over again will never get old &#8211; at least for us .. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is tired of hearing our travel stories. &#160; Grab your BFF, pick your destination, and get ready for the trip of a lifetime!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Want to embark on your own adventure? Create memories that will last a lifetime? Step outside of what you are used to and immerse yourself in a new culture! Fall 2017 we went to the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom for a study term abroad, and it changed our lives!  Here are ten reasons why studying abroad is SO worth it! &#160; &#160; 1. Make new friends from around the world Remember how exciting those first few weeks of a new school were? When everyone is friendly and open to meeting new people? Whether you are living in residence with the locals or in a global community with other international students, everyone is starting from scratch. People from all over may be your new flatmates, classmates, or friends in a club/society, either way going aboard is guaranteed to expand your social circle. With the ever expanding social media its easy to stay in touch! &#160; 2. See the world  By studying abroad you will see parts of the world like you haven&#8217;t before. You&#8217;ll get to experience a new country and all it has to offer from its culture to customs. Not only will you be immersed in your host city but getting to your neighboring countries and cities couldn&#8217;t be easier. Abroad in England? We took a 5 pound flight one-way to Dublin for a weekend and a 4 hour train to get across the entirety of Ireland. 3. Add it to your Résumé  Whether you are looking to further your education or jump into a career, going aboard will give you a competitive edge to stand out. Studying abroad shows commitment to your education, a desire to learn, and a curiosity that will be hard to beat! Graduate schools and employers look for these skills for new leaders in any field of study. &#160; &#160; 4. Experience life outside of your comfort zone  You are leaving behind everything that you know and are comfortable with, you&#8217;ll find yourself over coming a new situation everyday. Being in a new country puts yourself out there, you&#8217;ll take risks, get lost, try new things, and learn from each experience! &#160; &#160; 5. You&#8217;ll see your own culture from a new view Taking a step back from everything you know gives you a new view on life. A new perspective may help you learn things about your own culture and country you never thought of before. &#8220;Am I American? ARE YOU CRAZY I&#8217;M A CANADIAN, EH…&#8221; Let&#8217;s just say it made me patriotic as f***. Go Canada Go. 6. Self-discovery Leaving your home and everyone you know behind means you will have to rely on yourself. In no time you&#8217;ll be able to find your passions and your interest as you frolic new countries and embark on new adventures. This adventure of a life time will give you freedom and independence along the way. You will feel so empowered by the end! &#160; &#160; 7. Discover new and exciting food and drinks With each new country means a new food and drinks to try (best part)! Everything from eating out, to grocery shopping and cooking in a hostel will be new and you&#8217;ll discover new foods, ingredients, and recipes along the way! Did you know pumpkin pie is unheard of in the UK?! So don&#8217;t go looking for that this Thanksgiving. &#160; &#160; 8. Learn to appreciate the smaller things  Packing for 4 months of your life into one suit case can be a daunting task. Living without the comforts of the little things, like having more then two pairs of shoes to choose from, makes us realize some of the things we take for granted. &#160; &#160; 9. Get to know a new culture  Studying abroad immerses you in a new culture&#8217;s atmosphere, activities, politics, and sometimes even language(s). This deepens your understanding of the world and helps you become more empathetic. There is so much of the world to explore and doing it in person versus through a screen is one experience you wont want to miss. &#160; 10. You&#8217;re not visiting, you&#8217;re living  Navigating your university&#8217;s city like a local, you&#8217;ll discover all the hidden gems like the best cafés, bars, restaurants and more. What feels so foreign at first becomes so familiar and eventually you&#8217;ll find yourself a second home. You&#8217;ll be sad to leave! &#160;</p>

<h2><b>4. Experience life outside of your comfort zone </b></h2>
<p>You are leaving behind everything that you know and are comfortable with, you&#8217;ll find yourself over coming a new situation everyday. Being in a new country puts yourself out there, you&#8217;ll take risks, get lost, try new things, and learn from each experience!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>5. You&#8217;ll see your own culture from a new view</b></h2>
<p>Taking a step back from everything you know gives you a new view on life. A new perspective may help you learn things about your own culture and country you never thought of before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I American? ARE YOU CRAZY I&#8217;M A CANADIAN, EH…&#8221; Let&#8217;s just say it made me patriotic as f***. Go Canada Go.</p>

<h2><b>6. Self-discovery</b></h2>
<p>Leaving your home and everyone you know behind means you will have to rely on yourself. In no time you&#8217;ll be able to find your passions and your interest as you frolic new countries and embark on new adventures. This adventure of a life time will give you freedom and independence along the way. You will feel so empowered by the end!</p>

<h2><b>7. Discover new and exciting food and drinks</b></h2>
<p>With each new country means a new food and drinks to try (best part)! Everything from eating out, to grocery shopping and cooking in a hostel will be new and you&#8217;ll discover new foods, ingredients, and recipes along the way!</p>
<p>Did you know pumpkin pie is unheard of in the UK?! So don&#8217;t go looking for that this Thanksgiving.</p>

<h2><b>8. Learn to appreciate the smaller things </b></h2>
<p>Packing for 4 months of your life into one suit case can be a daunting task. Living without the comforts of the little things, like having more then two pairs of shoes to choose from, makes us realize some of the things we take for granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>9. Get to know a new culture </b></h2>
<p>Studying abroad immerses you in a new culture&#8217;s atmosphere, activities, politics, and sometimes even language(s). This deepens your understanding of the world and helps you become more empathetic. There is so much of the world to explore and doing it in person versus through a screen is one experience you wont want to miss.</p>

<h2><b>10. You&#8217;re not visiting, you&#8217;re living </b></h2>
<p>Navigating your university&#8217;s city like a local, you&#8217;ll discover all the hidden gems like the best cafés, bars, restaurants and more. What feels so foreign at first becomes so familiar and eventually you&#8217;ll find yourself a second home. You&#8217;ll be sad to leave!</p>
